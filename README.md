## Description
This is a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two numbers.

## Features
- Performs four basic operations: +, -, *, /
- Handles division by zero error
- Accepts floating-point numbers as input
- Provides clear output showing the operation performed

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Use
1. Run the program in a Python environment
2. Enter the first number when prompted
3. Enter the second number when prompted
4. Choose an operation from the available options (+, -, *, /)
5. View the result of the calculation

## Example Usage
```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): *
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0
```

## Error Handling
- The program displays an error message if division by zero is attempted
- The program displays an error message if an invalid operation is entered

## Limitations
- Currently only supports operations with two numbers
- No support for more advanced operations (exponents, roots, etc.)
- No graphical user interface (command-line only)

## Future Improvements
- Add support for more operations
- Implement a graphical user interface
- Add memory functions
- Support for calculations with more than two numbers
